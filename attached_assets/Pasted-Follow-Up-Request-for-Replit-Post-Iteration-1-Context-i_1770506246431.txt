Follow-Up Request for Replit (Post-Iteration 1)
Context (include this at the top)

We’ve completed the first functional iteration. The core flows work.
This request focuses on UI quality and admin-level control to make the product production-ready and scalable.

1. UI / Design System Upgrade (MANDATORY)
Goal

The UI must look intentional, modern, and professional — not default Tailwind, not “vibe coded,” not generic SaaS boilerplate.

This product targets business owners and regulated industries, so design quality directly impacts trust.

Design Requirements
Visual Style

Clean, minimal, modern

Neutral color palette (light background, subtle contrast)

No default Tailwind blue/indigo everywhere

No mismatched spacing or inconsistent font sizes

Typography

Use a professional sans-serif font (examples: Inter, Manrope, DM Sans)

Clear type scale:

Page titles

Section headers

Body text

Consistent line height and spacing

Components

Buttons, inputs, cards, modals must feel designed, not default

Rounded corners consistent across the app

Subtle hover/focus states

Proper empty states (not blank screens)

Layout

Use a clear layout system:

Sidebar for authenticated users

Top navigation for public pages

Content should not feel cramped or overly wide

Mobile responsiveness must remain intact

Explicit UI Anti-Patterns to Avoid

No raw Tailwind defaults

No mismatched margins/paddings

No “everything is a card” layouts

No placeholder-looking forms

Acceptance Criteria (UI)

App feels comparable to modern SaaS tools (Stripe, Linear, Notion-lite)

Business owner would trust this product visually

No screen feels unfinished or improvised

2. Admin Login & Admin Privileges (MANDATORY)
Goal

Introduce a separate admin role with elevated privileges to manage the platform, users, and businesses.

This is required for:

Moderation

Support

Future monetization

Compliance

Admin Authentication
Requirements

Admin login is separate from business user accounts

Admin users have a role flag: role = admin

Non-admin users must never access admin routes

Routes

/admin/login

/admin/dashboard

Admin Capabilities (V1 Scope)
Admin Dashboard

Admin must be able to view:

All businesses

Business name

Created date

Status (active / disabled)

All users

Email

Role

Associated business

Basic usage stats

QR scans

Review generations

Concern flow count

Admin Actions

Admin must be able to:

Disable / enable a business

Disable / enable a user

View a business’s generated QR links

View aggregate usage metrics (read-only)

⚠️ Admin cannot:

Edit reviews

Generate reviews

Act as a customer

(Admin is oversight, not participation.)

Security Rules (Non-Negotiable)

Admin routes must be protected by:

Role-based middleware

If a non-admin hits /admin/*:

Redirect to /login

Admin actions must be logged (basic audit log)

3. Routing Updates (If Not Already Done)

Admin routes must be real routes (not modals)

URL must update when navigating admin sections

Refreshing admin pages must not break state

4. Data Model Updates (Minimal)

Add:

role field to users (admin | business)

is_active flags for users and businesses

Admin-only API endpoints

No need for permissions matrix yet — simple role checks are fine.

5. What NOT to Do in This Iteration

Do not redesign flows

Do not add analytics dashboards

Do not add payments

Do not over-engineer permissions

This iteration is UI polish + admin control only.

Final Instruction to Replit (Important)

Prioritize design consistency, clean structure, and admin safety over adding new features.
This iteration should make the product feel credible, professional, and scalable.
