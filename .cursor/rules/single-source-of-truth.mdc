# TapBack: Edit Here Only

This project at **Desktop TapBack** (`C:\Users\ahmad\Desktop\TapBack`) is the **single source of truth** for the user and their teammate.

- **All code changes** for TapBack must be made in this project only.
- **Do not** write or duplicate code in the Cursor worktree (`hxr` or any other worktree).
- The user and their friend run and pull from this repo; editing only here avoids double work and keeps one place to maintain.

When asked to add features, fix bugs, or change TapBack code, edit files under `C:\Users\ahmad\Desktop\TapBack` only.
